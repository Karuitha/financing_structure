Current Legal Status: We create a dummy with the MFIs following the NGO Model getting a code of zero, and one in the case of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), rural banks, and credit unions/ cooperatives. We assign codes of zero to four for the multinomial logit model for NGOs, Banks, NBFIs, Cooperatives and Rural Banks, respectively. The data are available from the Microfinance Information Exchange, MIX (See source on note 1). The legal status may dictate the profit orientation and sources of capital for the MFIs. The legal status of an MFI may impact the financing structure in several ways. First, legal restrictions typically restrict NGOs from taking deposits which lowers both the debt-equity ratio and deposit to assets, hence raising the capital asset ratio. Also, NGOs may not venture into capital markets for funds given their mostly not-for-profit orientation. The opposite is the case for MFIs like commercial banks whose legal status allows for deposits."", """", "

Older firms are likely better established, have a solid reputation and hence likely to attract more debt and deposits. The correspondence between age and debt is captured in the institutional life cycle view of Bayai and Ikhide (2016)"", """", "

Legal Tradition (Legal): The indicator is a dummy variable with common law countries coded 0, civil law countries 1, and 2 otherwise as per the classification by Oto-Peralías and Romero-Ávila (2014). Typically, common law countries have relatively better financial infrastructure that allows firms to easily access financial markets. Hence, MFIs in common law countries may exhibit higher debt and equity ratios in their capital structures than those in common law and other legal traditions.

Assets are the sum of capital and liabilities- the total value of resources owned or controlled by the MFI resulting from past events and from which the MFI will derive future benefits. We expect firms with more assets to have a higher debt capacity and hence more debt to equity ratio and lower capital to equity ratio. Large firms draw their strength from holding diversified investments and hence higher capacity to absorb risk. Besides, they have easy access to debt markets(Kurshev & Strebulaev, 2015). Besides, these firms would attract more deposits, given the trust they inspire in depositors and marketing reach (Kimmel et al., 2018). We hypothesise that donations vary positively with the size of MFI, as large, older firms have established a reputation with donors."", """", "

Governance/ Institutional Quality (KKM): We take the first principal component of the WGI developed by Daniel Kaufmann, Aart Kraay and Massimo Mastruzzi (KKM) available on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators, WGI (See source on note 3). Governance and institutional quality are important for two reasons. First, people living in countries with well developed institutions have better access to financial services, which lowers the demand for microfinance. Secondly, better institutions correspond to well developed financial markets, meaning that the existing financial institutions can easily access debt and equity, including deposits. "", """", "

Private Credit to GDP: We capture the total amount of credit advanced to the private sector by financial intermediaries as a proxy for capital markets development concerning the banking sector following Ito and Kawai (2018). The data source is the Global Financial Development Database, GFDD, of the World Bank (See note 4). Private credit to GDP represents the financial resources provided to the private sector by domestic money banks as a share of GDP. Domestic money banks comprise commercial banks and other financial institutions that accept transferable deposits, such as demand deposits. The data is available in WDI. Financial sector development is central to the acquisition of both equity and debt financing. We hypothesise a high debt to equity ratio, and deposits to assets ratios in countries with more robust financial sectors as financial institutions tend to be highly leveraged."", """", "

Although Africa's equity markets are thin, some relatively large stock markets like South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana exist. The data are from the GFDD."", """", "
